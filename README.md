## 📌 Abstract

Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) diagnosis, particularly through tongue inspection, faces persistent challenges in **subjectivity** and **reproducibility**. The application of multimodal artificial intelligence to TCM clinical tasks, such as syndrome differentiation and prescription generation, is significantly hampered by the **semantic gap** between visual tongue features and textual reasoning, as well as the **lack of large-scale, standardized datasets**.

To address these challenges, we introduce **MMIR-TCM**, a novel framework that emulates the diagnostic process of TCM experts by integrating:

- 🧠 **Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)**
- 🎯 **Memory-augmented Segmentation**
- 📚 **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**

---

## 🏗️ Framework Architecture

MMIR-TCM employs a **three-stage architecture**:

### Stage 1: Memory-SAM (Training-free)
- 🖼️ Robust tongue extraction from clinical images
- 🔍 Memory-augmented segmentation for precise region identification

### Stage 2: Qwen3-VL (Fine-tuned)
- 📊 Structured tongue diagnosis generation
- 🎨 Visual feature analysis and interpretation

### Stage 3: Qwen3-based RAG
- 📖 Evidence-grounded clinical decision support
- 💊 Prescription generation based on retrieved medical knowledge

## 📊 MedTCM Dataset

We introduce **MedTCM**, a new large-scale multimodal dataset specifically designed for advanced TCM research.

### Key Features

- 📸 **Large-scale**: Comprehensive collection of tongue images
- 🏥 **Standardized**: Consistent annotation protocols
- 🌐 **Multimodal**: Images + Text + Clinical Records
- ✅ **Expert-validated**: Quality assurance by TCM practitioners

## 🔬 Technical Details

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Our RAG system integrates:
- 📚 Medical knowledge base retrieval
- 🔗 Context-aware information fusion
- 💡 Evidence-grounded decision making

---

## 📈 Evaluation Metric: TDEU

To properly evaluate clinical accuracy, we developed **TDEU** (Tongue Diagnosis Evaluation Unit), a domain-specific metric incorporating:

- 🎯 **Semantic Understanding**: Captures medical terminology
- ⚖️ **Diagnostic Importance**: Weights critical features
- 🔍 **Clinical Relevance**: Aligns with expert assessment

Traditional metrics fail to capture the nuances of TCM diagnosis. TDEU addresses this gap by:

```
TDEU = α × Semantic_Similarity + β × Diagnostic_Accuracy + γ × Clinical_Relevance
```

## 🏆 Results

### Performance Comparison

| Model | TDEU ↑ | Syndrome Acc. ↑ | Prescription F1 ↑ |
|-------|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| GPT-4o | 0.742 | 68.3% | 0.651 |
| Gemini 2.5 Flash | 0.758 | 71.2% | 0.673 |
| **MMIR-TCM (Ours)** | **0.847** | **82.5%** | **0.789** |

MMIR-TCM **significantly outperforms** leading models including GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Flash.
